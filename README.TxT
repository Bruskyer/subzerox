                SubZeroX -- Revival of SubZero



 [++++] LINUX HAS BEEN UNTESTED, THERE MIGHT BE A ADDRESS ERROR [++++]
HOW TO RUN:
It's as simple as [python main.py], make sure to do [pip install -r requirements.txt]
If on linux you use "python3 main.py [PATH_TO_SUBLIME]"
On windows, upon running the script it should open explorer.exe
where you choose sublime_text.exe. Then it should patch.

Notes:
I decided to revive my project since some people
liked it, I did not expect to even be noticed.
Also I will add more patches for Sublime Merge, etc, when I have time.
Sorry for not adding a Markdown readme, if you would like
that let me know. I have not done alot of coding so, the code
is not good but if you want you can fork it, =] - socialfright
Features:
    Automatic Binary Detecton
    Latest offsets for Sublime Text 4152 (Stable)
